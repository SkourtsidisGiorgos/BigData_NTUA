# Big_Data_NTUA
Project for the 2020-2021 NTUA ECE class "Advanced Databases". 

Students had to write queries using both PySpark's interfaces: RDD and SparkSQL. 
SQL queries had to be tested on both CSV and PARQUET files and compare differences between all the results.

In part B, we had to implement 2 distributed join algorithms (repartition and broadcast join) and compare the results. 
We also had to experiment with Spark's query join optimizer.
